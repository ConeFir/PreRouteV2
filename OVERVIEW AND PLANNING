Welcome to PreRoute, John's first attempt to build a cross-platform API engagement tool.

This document lays out my planning for this tool, in broad brushstrokes.

The functionality of this app is as follows:
(1) INTERACT with Google Calender API to GET the events of the primary calender.

(2) For every event in the primary calender, be able to extract:
    (a) Name
    (b) ID
    (c) Start time
    (d) End time
    (e) Location
    
(2) INTERACT with Google Maps API to GET bus routes, according to the following criteria:

    For each event in the primary calender, look for a bus route from the location of
    that event to the location of the subsequent event, with the departure time of that route
    being the next avaiable departure time *after* the first event's end time, and its arrival
    time falling before the second event's start time.
    
    IF there is no such route, return "no such route exists."
    
    IF there is a route, then create a new event in the primary calender, with the event's title
    being "Bus from "FIRSTEVENTNAME" to "SECONDEVENTNAME," via "ROUTENAME."
    
    IDEALLY: This event includes a link to the bus route in question.
    
(3) Build a GUI with tkinter for this application. The GUI should have the following functionality:
    (a) A button that loads and displays your events.
    (b) A button that says 'PreRoute my calender," and
        (c) Returns an image or images of the bus route, which you should be able to click through.
        (d) Returns a listing of your new events.
        OR
        (e) An error message specifying what went wrong.
