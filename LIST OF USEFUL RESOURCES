As some point, we may want to embed a google maps frame into our application. This is free. Here is the website.

NOTE that this just basically returns a google maps page. It's NOT a static image.

If we want to just get a static image, we can use this:

Apparently the location process we'll want is called GEOCODING, which turns places into GPS data (I think?)

Here is the client library for Maps API.

OH and here's the API we'll use to make route requests. It's called distance matrix.
