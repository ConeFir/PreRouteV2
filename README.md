# PreRouteV2

Welcome to the PreRoute V2 Repository! As PreRoute is my first serious foray into application development, this repository is something of a grab-bag, including early drafts, failed additions, and some early efforts at documentation. This repository is also my first effort to learn the core functionalities of git and github, so I apologize if it seems a bit unorganized! 

What is PreRoute? PreRoute is an application whose core functionality is to take a given user's Google Calendar and schedule events corresponding to bus rides in the user's calendar, utilizing Google Directions and Maps APIs. It's core server-side code is written in Python, and as of V2, it's interface is simple text. The principle aim of V3, which I hope to finish by the end of 2022, is to expand this functionality into a mobile interface written in Kotlin, backed by a simple webservice written in Flask.

Where can you find PreRoute? The current version of PreRoute is the file named PreRoute_Current_Version.py. I've been working on documentation for this program over the last while and hopefully that will be uploaded soon!

In the event you have questions about any of the code here, or about me, please don't hesitate to reach out!
