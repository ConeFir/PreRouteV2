THINGS WE'LL NEED TO DO, CONCRETELY:

AIMS:
    1. Show possibility of this app.
    2. Figure out technical requirements
    3. Execute technical requirements.

TASKS FOR PROVING THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS APPLICATION:
    1.  Make sure we can use multiple APIs simultaneously within an app.
    2.  Ensure that the data used for event locations can also be used for
        finding data on Google Maps.

TASKS FOR FIGURING OUT TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Find out:
        (a) whether the code required for checking bus routes is within my abilities.
        (b) whether locations in calenders can be integrated with locations in maps.

LIST OF QUESTIONS:
    1. Does maps have python support?
        Appears the answer is yes. Look in useful resources.

THINGS I DID:
    INSTALLING LIBRARIES
    1. Ran the pip for calender api:
    pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    2. Checked to see if maps requires a distinct pip.
    Answer: It does! Here it is:
    $ pip install -U googlemaps
    This, and some important details, covered at:
    https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python
    And, it looks like directions and geocoding are inbuilt.
    3. Located the quickstart for calender api:
    https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python
    4. Locate the quickstart for maps api
    Appears it doesn't exist, but I suspect that the github source gives us what we need.
    GETTING AUTHENTICATIONS
    API ID for 3 Maps Applications: AIzaSyD_XLgfF2vGYTxVThNrmLmwJcnuMl2pX-I
    OAuth ID = 591382261109-iuu8icip8se1id53i2cktdbis1s642jd.apps.googleusercontent.com
    OAutho Secret = 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
    I added this key to the PreRoute Main File.
    Recommendation: "Use this key in your application by passing it with the key=API_KEY parameter."
